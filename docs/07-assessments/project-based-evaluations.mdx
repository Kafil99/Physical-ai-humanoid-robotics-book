## Project-based Evaluations and Rubrics

This book emphasizes hands-on learning, and the best way to solidify your understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics is through practical application. This chapter outlines the assessment criteria and provides rubrics for evaluating your progress and mastery of the concepts learned throughout the book. These evaluations are designed to be project-based, mimicking real-world development scenarios.

**Objective**: Assess your ability to create, configure, and communicate between ROS 2 nodes.
