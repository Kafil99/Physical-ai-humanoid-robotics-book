# Implementation Plan: Expand Book Content

**Branch**: `001-create-robotics-book` | **Date**: 2025-12-16 | **Spec**: `specs/001-create-robotics-book/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-create-robotics-book/spec.md`

## Summary

The book's content will be revised and expanded across all modules to ensure consistency and clarity. This plan outlines the process for developing each module with slightly more detail than the current version, including clear explanations of core concepts, structured subtopics, and brief supporting examples.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (Docusaurus v3)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React
**Storage**: N/A (Static Content)
**Testing**: Manual review of generated content, local Docusaurus builds
**Target Platform**: Web (via GitHub Pages)
**Project Type**: Single project (Docusaurus site)
**Performance Goals**: Page loads in under 5 seconds on a 3G network
**Constraints**: Content must be clear, concise, and tutorial-friendly. All code examples must be tested and accurate.
**Scale/Scope**: Expand content for all existing modules (approx. 20-30 chapters).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Clarity**: All generated content will be reviewed for clarity and ease of understanding.
- **Consistency**: All modules will follow a uniform structure and writing style.
- **Accuracy**: All new code examples and technical explanations will be verified.
- **Deployability**: The site will be built locally after each major content addition to ensure it remains deployable.

**Result**: PASS
