# Data Model: RAG Answer Agent

This feature introduces a set of logical components and data structures for the agent's operation.

## Logical Components

### 1. The Agent

- **Description**: The central orchestrator, built using the OpenAI Agents SDK. Its primary role is to interpret the user's query and decide which tool to use.
- **Implementation**: An instance of an OpenAI `Agent` object, configured with a specific LLM (`gpt-4o-mini`) and a system prompt that defines its behavior.

### 2. The Tool: `retrieve_book_content`

- **Description**: A function exposed to the agent. It acts as the agent's "knowledge source".
- **Inputs**:
    - `query` (string): The user's natural language question.
- **Outputs**:
    - A `list` of `string`s, where each string is a formatted representation of a retrieved content chunk, including its text and metadata.

## Data Structures

### 1. Tool Call

- **Description**: An internal representation used by the agent to decide to use a tool. It contains the name of the tool to call and the arguments to pass to it.

### 2. Tool Output

- **Description**: The data returned from the `retrieve_book_content` tool. This is a list of strings that will be formatted and injected into the agent's prompt.
- **Example**:
  ```json
  [
    "Source: /docs/page1.md, Chunk: 1, Content: ...",
    "Source: /docs/page2.md, Chunk: 5, Content: ..."
  ]
  ```

### 3. Final Answer

- **Description**: The final string generated by the agent's LLM after it has processed the tool output. This is the answer that will be displayed to the user.
- **Example**:
  ```
  "Based on the book content, a ROS 2 node is the smallest unit of execution..."
  ```
