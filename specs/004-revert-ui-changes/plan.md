# Implementation Plan: Revert UI Changes

**Branch**: `004-revert-ui-changes` | **Date**: 2025-12-16 | **Spec**: `specs/004-revert-ui-changes/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-revert-ui-changes/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan defines the steps required to fully reverse all UI and logo-related changes made during the previous enhancement phase. The objective is to restore the project to its original visual state, including the previous UI design, color scheme, typography, and absence of any newly designed custom logo, while ensuring no functional behavior is affected. This is a strict UI rollback to the original baseline.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/React (Docusaurus v3)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus theming (Infima CSS framework)
**Storage**: N/A (UI assets and configuration)
**Testing**: Visual inspection against original baseline, Docusaurus local build
**Target Platform**: Web (Static site generated by Docusaurus)
**Project Type**: Single project (Docusaurus site)
**Performance Goals**: Page load performance consistent with the original version.
**Constraints**: This is strictly a UI rollback. No new UI improvements or refinements are allowed. Functional behavior must remain unchanged.
**Scale/Scope**: Revert UI across all affected Docusaurus pages; revert logo integration.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

-   **Clarity**: The reverted UI must align with the original clarity.
-   **Consistency**: The reverted UI must restore original consistency.
-   **Accuracy**: The revert must accurately restore the previous state.
-   **Deployability**: Changes must not break the Docusaurus build or deployment to GitHub Pages.

**Result**: PASS

docusaurus.config.js        # Revert to original configuration
sidebars.js                 # Revert to original configuration
```

**Structure Decision**: Reversion will primarily affect `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`, `src/css/custom.css`, `src/pages/index.js`, `src/components/HomepageFeatures.js`, and the image assets in `static/img/`.

## Complexity Tracking

N/A - No constitution violations.
