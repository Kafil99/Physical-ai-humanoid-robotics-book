# Implementation Plan: Enhance UI and Integrate Custom Logo

**Branch**: `003-enhance-ui-logo` | **Date**: 2025-12-16 | **Spec**: `specs/003-enhance-ui-logo/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-enhance-ui-logo/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the process to improve the project’s user interface (UI) to be more modern, clean, and user-friendly, while maintaining simplicity and consistency. It also includes the design and integration of a custom logo that aligns with the project’s identity, enhancing brand recognition and visual appeal.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/React (Docusaurus v3)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus theming (Infima CSS framework)
**Storage**: N/A (UI assets and configuration)
**Testing**: Manual visual inspection, Docusaurus local build, Automated WCAG checks
**Target Platform**: Web (Static site generated by Docusaurus)
**Project Type**: Single project (Docusaurus site)
**Performance Goals**: Maintain current page load performance; ensure smooth UI transitions.
**Constraints**: UI improvements should not require major functional changes. Logo design should be simple and scalable.
**Scale/Scope**: Refine UI across all existing Docusaurus pages; integrate logo across header and favicon.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

-   **Clarity**: The UI and logo must enhance clarity for users.
-   **Consistency**: Design principles enforce consistency across all UI elements.
-   **Accuracy**: UI implementations must accurately reflect design specifications.
-   **Deployability**: Changes must not break the Docusaurus build or deployment to GitHub Pages.

**Result**: PASS

### Source Code (repository root)

```text
src/
├── components/
│   └── HomepageFeatures.js # Will be updated to match new UI styles
├── css/
│   └── custom.css          # Primary file for UI styling changes
└── pages/
    └── index.js            # Main homepage component
static/
└── img/
    ├── logo.svg            # Custom logo file will be placed here
    └── favicon.ico         # Updated favicon
```

**Structure Decision**: The existing Docusaurus project structure will be used. UI styling changes will primarily occur in `src/css/custom.css`, and logo assets will be placed in `static/img/`. Modifications to Docusaurus configuration (`docusaurus.config.js`) and page components (`src/pages/index.js`, `src/components/HomepageFeatures.js`) will be made as needed.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Design & Preparation
-   **Goal**: Define the visual identity and prepare assets.
-   **Tasks**:
    -   Create wireframes/mockups for the new UI layout.
    -   Design the custom logo (SVG format).
    -   Verify color palette, typography, and component styles.

### Phase 2: Implementation Setup
-   **Goal**: Apply global styling changes.
-   **Tasks**:
    -   Add global CSS updates for layout, typography, color palette.
    -   Prepare `HomepageFeatures.js` for styling changes (e.g., ensure it uses standard Docusaurus classes or is ready for new custom styles).

### Phase 3: Logo Integration
-   **Goal**: Integrate the custom logo across the application.
-   **Tasks**:
    -   Integrate custom logo into header and favicon.
    -   Ensure logo matches theme and is responsive/scalable.

### Phase 4: UI Component Updates
-   **Goal**: Apply specific styling to individual components and ensure responsiveness.
-   **Tasks**:
    -   Update `HomepageFeatures.js` with new styles.
    -   Apply responsive design changes across all components (implicitly covered by `custom.css` but explicit check here).

### Phase 5: Review & Refinement
-   **Goal**: Validate the UI against design and accessibility standards.
-   **Tasks**:
    -   Verify visual feedback for interactive components.
    -   Perform automated WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility checks.
    -   Cross-browser and device responsiveness testing.

### Phase 6: Final Assessment
-   **Goal**: Confirm all success criteria are met.
-   **Tasks**:
    -   Confirm positive qualitative UI assessment.
    -   Confirm custom logo is correctly rendered on all pages.
