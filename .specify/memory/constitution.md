# Project Constitution: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation with Docusaurus

## Core Principles

- **Clarity**: All content must be clear and easily understandable for technical readers, including developers and students.
- **Consistency**: The structure, formatting, and writing style must be consistent across all chapters and modules.
- **Accuracy**: All code examples, technical explanations, and hardware requirements must be accurate and tested.
- **Deployability**: The entire Docusaurus site must build without errors and be deployable to GitHub Pages.

## Key Standards

- **Writing Style**: The tone should be clear, conversational, and friendly, suitable for a tutorial format.
- **Code Blocks**: All code examples must be tested and fully functional. They should be copy-paste ready.
- **Format**: All content will be written in Docusaurus-compatible Markdown (.mdx).
- **Headings**: Headings must follow a logical hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3) to ensure readability and proper document structure.
- **Links**: Internal navigation must use relative paths.

## Constraints

- **Platform**: The project will be built using Docusaurus and deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages.
- **Tools**: Development will use Spec-Kit Plus for specifications and the Gemini CLI for content generation and automation.
- **File Structure**: The project will adhere to the standard Docusaurus conventions for `docs`, `static`, and other directories.
- **Images**: All images must be optimized for the web and stored in the `/static/img` folder.

## Success Criteria

- The Docusaurus site builds without any errors.
- All internal and external links work correctly.
- Navigation, including the sidebar and previous/next buttons, is fully functional.
- All code examples are accurate and can be run successfully on the target platform.
- The final site is successfully deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages.
