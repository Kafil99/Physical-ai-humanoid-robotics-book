## Prompt

Project: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation with Docusaurus

Core principles:
- Clarity for technical readers (developers/learners)
- Consistency in structure and formatting across chapters
- Accuracy in all code examples and technical explanations
- Deployability (all content must render correctly on GitHub Pages)

Key standards:
- Writing style: Clear, conversational, tutorial-friendly
- Code blocks: Tested and functional examples only
- Format: Markdown (.md or .mdx) compatible with Docusaurus
- Headings: Follow logical hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Links: Use relative paths for internal navigation

Constraints:
- Platform: Docusaurus static site deployed to GitHub Pages
- Tools: Spec-Kit Plus for specs, Gemini CLI for content generation
- File structure: Follow Docusaurus docs/blog conventions
- Images: Optimized for web, stored in /static folder

Success criteria:
- All pages build without errors
- Navigation works correctly across chapters
- Code examples are copy-paste ready
- Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages
